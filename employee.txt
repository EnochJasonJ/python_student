Scenario: Imagine you are managing the performance ratings for a team of employees. The ratings are recorded in an array where each element represents the rating of an employee. You need to find the second-highest distinct rating in the team. If the second highest distinct rating does not exist, return -1. This helps in identifying the top performers in the team.
Task: Write a function to find the second-highest distinct rating from an array of employee ratings. If the second highest rating doesn’t exist, return -1.
